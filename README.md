# **SINR-DASN**

## Data Preparation

- ### Cat Librispeech

The _train-clean-100_, _train-clean-360_, _dev-clean_, and _test-clean_ datasets in LibriSpeech, which contain speech from the same speakers, are concatenated, resulting in a total of 1252 utterances (251, 921, 40, and 40, respectively).

- ### Gen Room Impulse Response

1. The RIRs for the _Training Data_ and _Development Data_ are generated using `genRIR_ForFrmLvSINR_TrainingData.m`.
2. The RIRs for the _Test Data_ are generated using `genRIR_ForFrmLvSINR_TestData.m`.
3. The RIRs for the _Sensor-Selection Data_ are generated using `genRIR_ForFrmLvSINR_NodeSlct_Data.m`.

- ### Data Generation Procedure

1. To be continued.

# Updated on November 18, 2024

The code and datasets are currently under preparation.

(The original plan was to release it before November 20, but Iâ€™ve been too busy recently.)
